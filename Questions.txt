1. Calculate Load factor for each flight number (LF = Bookings/Capacity)
2. Create 4 time bands as per your intuition. (Divide the day into 4 parts. Ex. 00:00 AM-05:00 AM)
3. Identify top flight numbers for each sector and each time band
(Sector : Origin+ Destination pair) 
(Top Flight: Highest load factor within the sector & time band)

Do all the analysis (Data Cleaning, processing, standardization) in Excel.
